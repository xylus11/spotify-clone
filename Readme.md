               SPOTIFY CLONE



Your Spotify clone will be composed of the following components:
Header: This includes the Spotify logo, search functionality, and navigation links like 'Home', 'Search', and 'Your Library'.
Sidebar: This includes navigation links, album covers and titles for playlists, and the 'Get App' CTA.
Content Area: This includes a hero section with illustration, gradients, and text, a list of album covers, and a list of artist illustrations.
Player: This includes the currently playing album art, track title, artist, and playback controls.
Footer: This includes Home, About, Legal links, and social links to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
Each component should be built independently and then integrated into the complete webpage.





HTML & CSS Concepts Used
Here are the concepts utilised in the various sections of the clone. We recommend reviewing these concepts before starting the project. The most effective way to revisit these topics is by going over your assignments and participating in weekly contests.
We've distributed HTML and CSS concepts throughout each section, and you can find a list of the concepts used below:

HTML Tables & Forms
Semantic Tags
CSS Display Properties
CSS Positioning
Flex & Grids
Bootstrap
Media Queries
